# Disease-prediction-using-bayesian-network
 
 The idea of this project is to use causation instead of correlation to predict diseases that the patient can be suffering given some symptoms. The dataset used to predict diseases was verified by the doctors of local private hospitals. The bayesian network has two layers of symptoms and diseases that can be a result of specified symptoms. A basic website is built where the user can input mentioned symptoms and a report stating the possible diseases is formed.
